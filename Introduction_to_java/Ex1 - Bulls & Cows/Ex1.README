 * Ex1 Bulls & Cows - Automatic solution.
 * **** README ****
 * Bulls & Cows is a code-guessing game that challenges you to find a secret code with 2-6 digits.
 * After each guess, you receive feedback in the form of bulls and cows:
 * Bulls represent the correct numbers in the correct positions.
 * Cows represent correct numbers that are not in the right positions.
 * by getting this information you can strategically change your guesses until you guess the right code!
 *
 * **** General Solution (algorithm) ****
 * The automatic solving algorithm is a way to guess the code in the minimum possible attempts.
 * The program as a boolean array representing the possible guesses (Each index in the array corresponds to a number).
 * the first guess is "0000", after we get the bulls and cows feedback from the server, we disqualified
 * all the indexes (possible guesses) in the boolean array that do not match the same number of bulls and cows as the guess.
 * then we send the next possible guess from our boolean array until we successfully find the code.
 *
 * **** Results ****
 * for 2,3,4,5,6 digit code:
 *
 * Average guesses 2: 6.65
 * Average guesses 3: 7.64
 * Average guesses 4: 8.22
 * Average guesses 5: 8.75
 * Average guesses 6: 9.22
